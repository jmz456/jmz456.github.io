		<h4>How do you see Dev Bootcamp?</h4>
		<p><em>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</em> <br><br>
The DBC experience really seems more like a high intense workshop.  It sounds like an exciting atmosphere to be in where everyone has the chance to exchange ideas, learn new tricks and of course, learn to program.<br><br>

<em>What is your impression of DBC?</em> <br><br>
I can’t really say that I have a particular impression yet.  I do however see that students and staff really get to have this opportunity for open communication to not just talk about the material, but our thoughts and feelings as well.

<em>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</em> <br><br>
I’ve never been a person to delve into communication with others.  I’ve always been an observer and slowly become part of a conversation.  I really like listening to other people; so generally, I like to ask people about their opinions, visions or goals.<br><br>


<em>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?</em> <br><br>
My expectations about DBC haven’t changed much.  I know and understand it’s about how much we want to learn or get out of the program based on our thirst.  However, part of me still has the mind-set to be that customer in the restaurant expecting an order.<br><br>

<em>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?  Does it make you nervous?</em><br><br>
I’m am so excited to get to DBC Chicago and meet everyone.  I’m excited in engaging in experience and opportunity.  That’s what I’m nervous about the most.  Sometimes I feel great about code and terminology I’ve learned and then have a short conversation with someone that fully understands the assignment.  I’m nervous I will fall onto coattails not progress like others.<br><br>

What makes me really nervous of this kind of environment is that I’m worried I won’t bring my ‘A’ Game all the time.  I feel as if there is a lot of pressure with what we should know prior to Phase 1.  I’m worried that I’ve found something I like and won’t be good at it soon enough.<br><br>
