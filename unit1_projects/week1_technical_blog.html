		<h4>An Analysis on Website User Experience and Design</h4>
		<p> by J Miller<br><br>The world is turning inside out from reality to cyberspace.  Is that even a term anymore?<br><br>  The playing field is grows fiercer with companies opening their doors online.  No more Blockbuster, hello Netflix.  GameStop, it's been nice knowing you, but your luck will run out soon too.  Do you know how much a newspaper costs these days?  When's the last time you've read a newspaper?  I bet you read it on your phone like everyone else.  That transition didn't take long.  So what's the point of all this?<br><br>The online user experience takes care of the hard parts of the task.  We're driven to reach for our phones and read the news.  It's better than going out to buy a newspaper.  The people I catch reading newspapers probably forgot their phones or got it for free.  Seriously, why would you pay for an article when the same one is in your phone already?  Enough about those old sites, lets discuss how the user experience and design.<br><br>So what catches my eye when I'm on a website?  Better yet, before I go to a website, I must be looking for something?  Otherwise I'm just burning time surfing.<br><br>So I'll go into a little detail with Netflix, eBay and BBC just because, well, I want to.<br><br>Our first runner up is Netflix.  What a bunch of brilliant guys.  Now I'm not saying that Netflix put Blockbuster out of business, but they certainly helped.  Their DVD mail order option along with the free movies provided with the subscription service is superb.  The executives at Blockbuster were reluctant to change and had very little concern with bringing the experience to families.  Do you remember the late fees with Blockbuster?  I do.  What a way to turn an experience into something awful.  I could ramble on but I fear the digression... continuing on.  The experience you get with Netflix is a smooth transition from demand to supply.  The basic site lets you choose from a moderate library and if you want something new, just head into their DVD rental.  While you wait for that DVD, why not enjoy a movie from your subscription service in the meantime.  The design is geared toward your viewing preferences.  Thank you Netflix, if you fail, I still have YouTube.<br><br>When I want to know what's going on in the world and Netflix fails to give me news (I won't charge Netflix for that idea) BBC World News is my next favorite source for global updates.  The site is organized in a way that allows me to view the top stories and select specific categories to my liking.  That's probably one of the most important features in a news site is modifying you news feed that's important to you.  Little chance did we have paying 50 cents for a bunch of articles with a black and white pictures.  The experience is a news feed geared toward you.  I also like them because there's less irony and more truth than many other FOX... I mean... news websites.<br><br>Then we have eBay.  Ah eBay.  The only auction site where I can find and supply my hobby and make a purchase and know exactly what I'm buying.  However, if you've been shopping eBay as long as I have, you know what to watch out for.  You have to realize that eBay is a C2C (Consumer to Consumer) market.  You are, for the most part, buying second hand product.  However, a lot of people tend to underestimate the second hand market.  If you want something new and there are plenty in the C2C market, be patient and you'll pay prices cheaper than Amazon.  Auctions tend to be very exciting, but that's not what's so special about an auction.  An auction brings a return customer.  There are a ton  of people that come back to view the status of their auction.  How brilliant is that?  You make people comeback and they want to.  I tend to purchase and sell on eBay when the time is right.  Setting it all up and working on the side takes more effort than I would like... shame on me being lazy... how much easier do they have to make selling something?  </p>
