		<h4>Tech Addiction</h4>
		<p><em>A Rapidly Growing Dependency.</em> <br><br>



How to you feel when you misplace your smartphone?  Have you taken a break once to leave it at home?  If you have a family, could you still do it?  How often do you take your phone to the bathroom?<br><br>
<img>
We're all addicted to it.  What's worse?  I bet a crack addict has an easier time quiting their habit.  Perhaps excessive... but let's dig deeper.<br><br>

I'm won't be prejudice.  I'll make this a global conversation.  I myself have been guilty of everything you read. <br><br>

Let's start with education.  Whether in college or grade school, 99% of research completed by students is on the computer.  That's not a problem.  The resources on the web are incredibly valuable if you know what to look for, how to search for it, if it's properly dated and the source is reliable.  However, that's not always going to happen.  Even media is accessible from the web.  So what's the problem?  We tend to use the web as a solution to our academic weaknesses.  The truth is, getting up to find the solution is becoming harder and harder as we assume technology is the Band-Aid to problems in education.  Education Week reported on a major federal study that found, "no difference in academic achievement between students who used the technology in the classrooms and youngsters who used other methods.  Tech doesn't make kids smarter, studying is a learned skill.  Tech can cheat kids in the mix.<br><br>

The toilet.  Oh shame on you.  If you take your phone to the bathroom, why would I want to know what you've been doing in there?  I will admit, it's a lot more subtle than taking a newspaper, but I mean common!  Where do you put your phone when you... well... use tissue?!  I admit, letting someone use your phone at this point makes a pretty good practical joke... but, you press that phone up against the side of your head, too. Ewwww!<br><br>

While I was living in Korea, I just got there in time to see the smartphone burst.  Within a year of my stay, everyone in the country had a smartphone.  Okay, I exaggerate, almost everyone.  However, that's not the kicker.  When those service plans contracts expired what do you think they did with their old phones... gave them to their kids.  I lived in Korea for 5 years.  Before I left.  Schools were quiet in the afternoon.  Kids aren't screaming.  They're texting and playing games.  I couldn't only see a bunch of tiny heads buried into their cellphones.  Hop on a subway in Korea (totally amazing by the way) and everyone is buried in their phones.  Not that it's a bad thing, what else are you going to do on the train, you get my point.

We need to continue to learn about tech etiquette.  What's right and wrong where.  Sure it's addicting, and it doesn't have to be bad.  We just need to be as responsible with our daily lives and look up every once in a while to make sure THAT MAC TRUCK DOESN'T HIT YOU!  Whew, close call.  Remember y'all... tech responsibly.<br><br>
