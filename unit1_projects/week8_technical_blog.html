		<h3>What is Rails?</h3>
		<p>

<p>Ruby is an object oriented programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto.  The Ruby language was created in 1995.  Rails is an open-source, web application framework that is written in the Ruby language.  It was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson.  

<p>A web application framework is  a collection that packages HTML, CSS and Programming language files designed to help developers build web applications.</p>

<p>Some useful framework features could be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>user accounts with ability to register, login, and reset passwords</li>
		<li>templates for data persistence</li>
		<li>security</li>
		<li>an adiminstrator interface</li>
	</ul>
<p>There aer many different web application frameworks for different languages.  PHP has CakePHP, Laravel.  Python had Django and Flask.  Ruby has Rails.

<p>So again, what is Rails? Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby.  It gives you a set of framework features that allow create pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates.  It provides the keys to create a web application.</p>
