		<h4>Stereotype threat</h4>
		<p><em>Is it a Stereotype threat or an issue of confidence?</em> <br><br>



<p>I’ve lived the stereotype threat all to well as an Asian American.  However, I gave up on it early in my life and realized it wasn’t something that should affect me personally.  From my sense, some people will always target me with some sort of stereotype, will always feel uncomfortable around me, I may feel uncomfortable around them, but to me that’s okay.  It’s more about knowledge and education than anything else.  You’ll experience changes when you start to see more of the world.  It’s all about how comfortable one is with oneself.</p>
<p>I could share so many instances as I was growing up.  Although I should clarify something from the beginning.  My ethnic background is half Korean, with roots from Ireland, Scotland and Germany.  My Korean side is more prominent in my physical features.  However, growing up, people would only see Korean.   I grew up as an American, but no one ever saw it that way. </p>
<p>I don’t think it really affected my achievement in any way.  However, my social life is what really took a hit.  My father was in the military and stability is something our family lacked.  I eventually isolated myself until high school and for a long time, found myself in socially awkward situations.  I looked a bit too different to qualify as someone to talk too.  Mix that with new kid and you get a sad recipe for loneliness. </p>
<p>The only time I felt completely out of place was playing basketball in high school with all the students being African American.  Most of us minorities felt the stereotype threat in that situation.  The basketball coach wasn’t much help either.   However, when I witnessed one other Korean playing just as well as them.  This gave me my first hunch that it was something deeper.  I realized it was a confidence issue, not a stereotype threat. </p>
<p>What made this kid so different that he could stand up to all these other African-American kids?  Maybe he was crazy or maybe he just didn’t care.  Their race had no affect on his ability to perform and achieve.  What I needed to ask myself was why did I feel so inferior.  I assumed that being Asian (because that's how others identified me) there was always something expected of me.  Something that people wanted from me.  I learned to give that up and realize that people just didn’t understand. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, the only place I really felt the stereotype was in Korea.  No one really knew I was Korean.  Everyone only knew me as, “White American.”  However, it was years earlier that I realized what others thought wasn’t important.  If I found myself in that situation and if  either of us were uncomfortable, we would break down the barriers.  I’ve met a lot of amazing people this way.  </p>
<p>Whenever I feel a stereotype threat or see it happen, I get involved.  I understand that being different just means the opportunity to educate others and learn new cultures.  Everyone is different, that’s just how it is.  Sometimes I feel myself stereotype others too, but I do my best to break barriers and open doors.  </p>
<p>I wouldn’t say stereotype threat is misconstrued as lack of confidence, but rather, make sure you don’t mix up one with the other. </p>
<p>Besides, didn’t you know that understanding the cultures of others was the new trend in this day and age? </p>
