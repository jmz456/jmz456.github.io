Only when their limits are shattered can the attainable be reached.<br> ~ Dr. Mark Mysnyk</em><h5>

		<h3>Who is James Miller?</h3>

			<p>I know we're supposed to drive from our inspiration.  I was hoping I would create an amazing website that people would revisit over and over.  I know I'll get to that point eventually.  However, then I realized, why not try to communicate who I am to world.  Who I am and things I've seen.

		<h3>The Boxer</h3>

I believe in protecting those who are meek and those you love.  I will never initiate a fight unless violently provoked.  I hate fighting for the sake of fighting. Boxing in a ring has a set of rules and code of conduct outside the ring.  That is all the difference.  <br>I was never a professional boxer.  It's just a sport I enjoy participating in.  I practiced and attended regulary for about 2 years.  When my daughter was born, practice subsided and my belly expanded beyond a proud belt notch.<br>I've always loved martial arts.  I took TaeKwonDo in highschool, a little KungFu (not really worth mentioning), and finally boxing.  Boxing has been the better sport for me as a person.  My physique and commitment were a good match.  It helped me deal with my anger management issues and think strategically.  <br>

		<h3>The Artist</h3>

It's always a work in progress for me.  If you would like to see some beginner art work, you'll have to twist my arm.  My pencil skills are not as confident as my punch. This image is a doodle of mine I did in about 20 minutes.  I like to call it,"The Drowned Stickman." The picture's original size is about 4 inches in width.
