		<h4>Conflict is our disagreement and argument from within.</h4>
		<p><em>Describe how you dealt with conflict.</em> <br><br>



The biggest question is when, where and with whom you deal with conflict. When it comes to the people you work with, dealing with conflict is pretty easy. The people you see or spend time with most of your day whether they’re hovering over or in the next room, cube or office are completely different than the guy that cut you off during your turn when you clearly signaled and had the right-of-way.<br><br>

One of my last managers held an open house for parents to watch their kids perform specific activities and show their progression and development. Clearly she wasn’t pleased with performance based on reviews returned from parents. ( she read 3 bad reviews came from a specific group of moms she spent a lot of time with.) So as she’s screaming at the top of her lungs about how incompetent we are at our jobs, the first thing comes to my mind, “obviously, this woman is angry.” <br><br>

Now I know that’s an obvious answer to any reader, but it’s different when your facing it. Everyone at the school performed excellently at their jobs so incompetence wasn’t the issue. So why did she scream? Well, she was actually in conflict. Some people handle conflict differently, some can think through it and understand themselves and some go into conflict themselves. The trick about conflict is... if you don’t recognize you’re in conflict, you will lose control or remain in conflict longer than you need to. <br><br>

So when someone like this, in this case management, is looking for answers. However, the answers they think they want, isn’t the answer they’re really looking for. I tend to play off this. This is where I come into control. The answer she was looking for was something that would bring her out of self-conflict. She didn’t need explanations. She needed the answers to bring her temper down. Not just the answers to our questions. She read three poor reviews that impacted her emotions. The first thing I did was... shut-up... and listen. Then gave the answers she was looking for, and did this by telling her I understand why she’s upset and probe for more details. In those details, I discovered the reviews came from important people to her. Clearly, her feelings were hurt. So I played on that, telling her we’ve don’t so much for those clients, the true status of their children and how those 3 parents obviously had a bad day and wanted to share that with my manager. Then a solution. Brings those parents back to see their children when they aren’t under pressure. Once she’s calm, everyone else is calm, and we can all go home relaxed, knowing we created new solutions and new ideas. <br><br>

This is one way I deal with conflict.  Sometimes our jobs just aren't easy.  Sometimes
others have a rough day at the office.  Understanding one another is more productive than
tearing each other apart.  Where we are and who we are with makes the difference.<br><br>

I try to do this with my kids too, but that's a different whom and another place. <br><br>
