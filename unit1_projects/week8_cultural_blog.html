		<h4>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h4>
		<p><em></em>


<h4>Pairing</h4>

<p>One of the great things about pairing with others was is much you learn and discover when are working together.  It's great getting to know everyone in the process and great knowing how much people are willing to help when challenges are overwhelming.  It was particularly rewarding to have guidance from everyone and I'm glad there have been times I could contribute even when I'm so new to this.  Everybody I've paired with have all been exceptional people.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult and yet frustrating parts of pairing is doing it online.  Even though we’re face to face over media, I can’t help but think how impersonal it can feel. I’m so excited to meet everyone face to face and get to know everyone.</p>


<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Feedback has been beneficial but at the same time, difficult to hear.   Constructive criticism isn’t the easiest for everyone.  While I know deep down that the purpose of the exercise is to increase our performance standards, it can become dishearenting when one notices a recurrence that they're trying to overcome.</p>

<p>There are times when I read my feedback and feel that I have both contributed and accomplished something within a challenge and in these several weeks.  I felt like I brought something good to a pairing session and learned a lot doing so.  However, more times than not, I felt I could have done something better.  I really wish I could contribute just as much as my pairing partners.</p>

<p>When I reviewed my feedback, I recognized one of the recurrences I had is that I should express myself more.  Usually when a topic is confusing, I’m very hesitant to ask questions and focus more on listening.  It can be a little embarrassing to say you’re lost, you don’t understand something or that you’ve forgotten something.  I know I have my moments of strength, but I would desperately love to overcome my weaknesses.  </p>

<p>Weaknesses are not easy to overcome.  I know it’s not something I can fix in a session.  The only thing I can do is continue doing my best, keep in mind to try and express myself more often and push through the tough challenges.</p>
