					<p>	Cultural Blog Week 9 - Struggles and Strategies</p>
						<p>One of the biggest struggles during Phase 0 was trying to complete challenges on my own while keeping my sanity.  However, this wasn't truly my big struggle.  I have a deeper underlying weakness, and that's reaching out to others and asking for help.</p>
						<p>It's not that I have problems getting to know people or asking for help, but it's the feeling of inadequacy on a topic of discussion and the failure to understand.  Whenever I'm out of my element or feel uncomfortable in a situation, I tend to freeze and lock up.  I don't ask questions, I become less inquisitive and more self conscious of my abilities.  </p>
						<p>This behavior could likely be associated to my difficulty in working with groups and social issues growing up. So I'm gonna tell you a little about myself and maybe you'll understand why my Concrete Sequential thinking style is the way it is. </p>
						<p>Growing up in a military family was very difficult.  Having a family stationed overseas and moving around was one of the most difficult lifestyles growing up. My life was completely disorganized until my Junior year of high school.  I needed stability.  I needed structure.  I needed organization.  </p>
						<p>Most of the time, I operate best when there is an order to things, a structure or predictability.  While I'm sure DBC will be the complete opposite, I've had to adapt plenty of times in the past, but this time it's with a great group of people.  I get to ask questions.  I can ask for help.  I have the opportunity to be side by side with others.  I can find the answers I need with not just my own research but also with confirmation.  Everyone can share their resources and we can all learn the little tricks that we've learned to become better coders. </p>
						<p>Meeting some of the boots on Thursday felt like such a great ice-breaker.  The help at DBC has been patient and have shown great concern.  Everyone has been truly great and fantastic.  I am really excited to get the chance to share this experience with everyone.  </p>
