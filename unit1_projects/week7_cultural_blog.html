		<h4>Reducing Stereotype threat</h4>
		<p><em>How can we reduce steretype threats and other self related issues?</em> <br><br>

<p>When I have to think back to our first blog, and relate it to what I’ve learned about stereotype threat I suddenly realize how all those values have a completely opposite in different scenarios in my life.    As our diversity increases over time, the higher the chance stereotype threat can experience, however, one could argue the reduction of that threat as well.   Of the stereotype threats I experience in my own life, my current values are the complete opposite of the values and emotions I felt at those times.  Most of my values are focused around strength: physical, mental and spiritual.  </p>
<p>Identifying a stereotype threat is easier once you feel it and having the self-knowledge to know you’re experiencing it.  However, I don’t necessary have these types of feeling anymore.  Although, while maybe not stereotyped, sometimes the threat of feeling less informed that others can hinder performance.  Especially when one thinks what is expected is more than the norm.  I know this will be something I have to face in this industry.  However, I’ve also had guidance from the fellows at DBC to avoid this thought and behavior.  Taking an approach to understand how I learn and how I’m different is what I need to help me succeed.  Once I’ve identified this threat, it’s easier to manage.  I’ve experienced how stress hinders my performance and I can reflect on plenty of past panic to prove it.  </p>
<p>I know that I will experience the negative feeling of performance issues.  Keeping this in mind allows me to intercept it early enough and realize that I need to take a time out.  I usually meditate to collect my thoughts and bring myself to a relaxed state.  The stress from the idea of failed performance deteriorates the ability to comprehend information and cognition is reduced dramatically. </p>
<p>Another exercise is to identify others in that situation and help intercept and pull them out of it.  I have the feeling that many will experience certain stresses and helping each other identify them can help us reflect on our own behavior and bring ourselves out of these states. </p>
<p>One of the harder and more effective exercises is to actually talk about your discomfort.  Bringing the topic to light can build reassurance that the underlying issue is smaller than it seems.  However, the fear and sense of vulnerability comes to into affect, which makes it one of the more difficult approaches. </p>
