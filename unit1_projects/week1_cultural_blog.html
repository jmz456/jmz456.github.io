		<h4>Exploring Your Values</h4>
		
		<p> <em><strong>When you think of times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</strong></em><br><br>
		Affection Ambition  Commitment Compassion Control Coolness under fire Courage Creativity  Enthusiasm Excitement Faith Friendships Growth Having a family Health Honesty Influence Introspection Patriotism Persistance Personal development Physical challenge Pleasure   Responsibility Self-knowledge Self-reliance Self-respect  Spirituality Truth Will-power Wisdom<br><br>

		One of the happiest moments in my life was when my daughter was born.  I've never experience that sort of happiness in my life next to having a family and meeting my wife.  However every experience is just a little different.  I can't weigh the enthusiasm, joy or love for each of these moments in my life.  Now that I have three kids running around the house, I wonder why I can't retract those emotions.<br><br>

		<em><strong>In general, I try to live up to these values: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</strong></em><br><br>

		With all these values, I agree that I do my best to live up to all of them.<br><br>

		<em><strong>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</strong></em><br><br>

		The last topic someone asked me about was the rules dating.  A co-worker contemplated dating two girls in the office.  Mind you we all shared this office together.  The staff were mostly women and there were massive cultural gaps.  Now he didn't date both girls at the same time, but he did like one and the other asked.  I gave warning the first time, and he failed to listen.  The result was an awkward office silence and whispering.  What can I say... it's a lonely planet.
