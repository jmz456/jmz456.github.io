		<h4>Arrays vs Hashes. What are they and what are they good for?</h4>
		<p>	Arrays and hashes are good for accessing and manipulating database like lists.<br><br>
Arrays are sorted by index using integers to create a collection of objects. Each element in an array can be either a string, an integer or a symbol and is linked to an index. <br><br>
Arrays are good mathematical functions for something as simple as multiplication tables to lists of objects, categories, or names. Regardless, it’s a list that returns a specific value from our index of request.  The objects in an array can be manipulated by adding to, removing, or accessing certain objects.  Once arrays become too long or need other keys to for searching, we can turn to hashes. <br><br>
A hash is a collection of key-value pairs.  It’s similar to an array.  With an array, your key is an integer only, but with hashes, you key can support any object.  You’re key could be a letter, a symbol, or a number. <br><br>
A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like: "Chevrolet" => "car dealer". It is similar to an Array, except the index is created by the user. <br><br>
In comparison, if you wanted to contain a list of the days of the week, it could look like so: <br><br>
week_days = [“Sunday”,”Monday”,”Tuesday”,”Wednesday”] <br><br>
However, if you wanted to convert it to an abbreviation, you could assign your own values. <br><br>
week_days = [“Sunday” => “Sun” , ”Monday” =>”Mon” ,  ”Tuesday”=> “Tues” , ”Wednesday”=> “Wed”] <br><br>
